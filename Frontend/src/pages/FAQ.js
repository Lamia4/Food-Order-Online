                <h3>Is the restaurant accessible?</h3>
                The restaurant building is accessible from the street to wheelchair users. Unfortunately, due to the listed status of the building, we are currently unable to offer any dedicated disabled toilets and access to the hotel guestrooms are by stairs only at this time.
                However, please be advised that we are currently in the process of building an entirely accessible cottage that will have priority access to Hjem reservations. We hope to complete this addition to our property in Spring 2022.

                <h3>Do I need to book a taxi beforehand?</h3>
                Be aware that rural Northumberland does not have many uber drivers or taxi ranks. We would recommend you organise your taxis in advance. We will happily organise a car for you with one of our recommended taxi companies if you would prefer.
                The restaurant also has an adjoining Hotel if you would prefer to stay the night after your meal. This can be booked as part of the restaurant reservation process.
